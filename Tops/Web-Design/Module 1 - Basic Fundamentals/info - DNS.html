what is DNS  ?
  DNS stands for Domain Name System, which is the system that translates domain names into IP addresses.
  DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources.
  Every device connected to the internet has its own IP address, which is used by other devices to locate the device.
  DNS servers make it possible for people to input normal words into their browsers.
