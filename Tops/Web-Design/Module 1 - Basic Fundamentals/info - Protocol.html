what is protocol  ?
  A protocol is a set of rules that determines how data is sent and received over a network.
  A protocol is just like a language that computers use to talk to each other.
  A protocol ensures they understand and can respond to each other’s messages correctly.
  Protocols help make sure that data moves smoothly and securely between devices on a network.
  Different types of protocols are used for different types of communication.
